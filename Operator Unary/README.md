## Operator Unary
##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- <samp>There are several types of Unary operators such as:</samp>

- <samp>positive (Indicating a Positive Value Number).</samp>

- <samp>negative (Indicating a Negative Value Number).</samp>

- <samp>Decrement '--' (variable value minus 1).</samp>

- <samp>Increment '++' (variable value plus 1).</samp>

- <samp>Increment prefix.</samp>
  
    <samp>Example :</samp>
    ```java
    int numberA = 10;

      System.out.printf("Value is ",++numberA);

      //Note : In the Increment prefix the result is 11 because the value of the variable "numberA" is added up first and then displayed. 
    ```
- <samp>Increment postfix.</samp> 
    ```java
    <samp>Example :</samp> 

    int numberB = 10;

      System.out.printf("Value is ",numberB++);

      //Note : In the Increment postfix the result is 10 because the value of the variable "numberB" is displayed first and then added up.
    ```
- <samp>Invert/Negation (inverts a value of boolean data type).</samp>
