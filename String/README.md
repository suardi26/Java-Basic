## String
##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- String is a data type that can hold a collection of characters such as words or sentences.
 
- String objects in Java are immutable, so when the string is created, its value cannot be changed.

- Operators on String that exist in the string class are:

    - 'charAt(index)' to retrieve character from String value.

    - 'substring' to take some character from String value.
    
    - 'toUpperCase' to convert String values to uppercase.

    - 'toLowerCase' to convert String values to lowercase.

    - 'replace' to replace a word in the String value.
    
    - 'equals' to compare the two string values whether they are equal.

    - 'compareTo' to compare String values alphabetically, when the first String value is greater than the second String value then the value
     
      is positive but when the second string is greater than the first string then the value is negative, when both values are equal it will be 0.

    - Concatenation '+' is used for concatenation of String values.
