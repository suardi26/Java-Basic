## Get User Input (Scanner, BufferReader, Console)
##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- <samp>There are 3 classes that are used to take input in text-based programs (Console), such as</samp> 
 
  <samp>Scanner Class, BufferReader Class, and Console Class.</samp>
  
    <samp>1. Class Scanner. </samp>
     
    <samp>The Scanner class is a class that provides functions for take the input entered by the user. to be able to access </samp>

    <samp>the scanner class, we first import the Scanner class, like 'import java.util.Scanner'.</samp>

    <samp>Method used in Class Scanner:

     - <samp> nextBoolean() -> Reads a boolean value from the user</samp>

     - <samp>nextByte() -> Reads a byte value from the user</samp>

     - <samp>nextDouble() -> Reads a double value from the user</samp>

     - <samp>nextFloat() -> Reads a float value from the user</samp>

     - <samp>nextInt()	-> Reads a int value from the user</samp>

     - <samp>nextLine() -> Reads a String value from the user</samp>

     - <samp>nextLong() -> Reads a long value from the user</samp>

     - <samp>nextShort() -> Reads a short value from the user</samp>
 
   <samp>2. BufferReader class.</samp>
 
   <samp>The BufferReader class is a class that provides functions to retrieve input entered by the user, However, the difference between</samp>
 
   <samp>a BufferReader and a Scanner is that the Scanner uses the next() method, while the BufferReader using readLine(). To be able</samp>
 
   <samp>to access the BufferReader class, we first import the BufferReader class, like 'import java.io.BufferedReader'.</samp>
   
   <samp>3.Console class</samp>
 
   <samp>Console class is a class that provides functions to take input entered by the user,</samp>
    
   <samp>Similar to BufferReader, Console also uses the readline() method to take user input.</samp>
 
   <samp>However, this class is only used in console environments, such as Terminal or CMD.</samp>
 
   <samp>To be able to access the Console class, we first import the Console class, such as 'import java.io.Console'.</samp>
