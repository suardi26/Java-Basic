## While And Do-While Looping
##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- <samp>While Loop is a programming technique used to repeat the process until a condition is invalid, so that the program</samp>

  <samp>code can be executed repeatedly according to the specified conditions.</samp>
  
  <samp>Format : </samp>
  ```java
          while (condition){
            
            // Code will be executed.
            
          }
    ```
          
- <samp>Just like 'While', 'do-while' is a programming technique used to repeat the process, but in 'do-while' it executes</samp> 

  <samp>the statement first and then checks for a condition. whilst the 'while' checks a condition first after that the statement</samp> 
  
  <samp>will be executed if the condition is true.</samp>
  
  <samp>Format :</samp>
  ```java
        do {
          
          // Code will be executed.
          
        } while (condition);
  ```
