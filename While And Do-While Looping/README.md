## While And Do-While Looping
##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- <samp>While Loop is a programming technique used to repeat the process until a condition is invalid, so that the program code can be executed repeatedly 

  according to the specified conditions.
  
  Format : 
  
          while (condition){
            
            // Code will be executed.
            
          }
          
          
- Just like 'While', 'do-while' is a programming technique used to repeat the process, but in 'do-while' it executes the statement first and 

  then checks for a condition. whilst the 'while' checks a condition first after that the statement will be executed if the condition is true.
  
  Format :
  
        do {
          
          // Code will be executed.
          
        } while (condition);
