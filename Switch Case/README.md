## Switch Case

##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- <samp>Switch Case is the same as 'if-else if' which is a programming technique used to determine the flow of program execution.</samp>  
 
  <samp>But for conditions in 'if-else if' it is more flexible because for 'if-else if' it can recognize comparison operators</samp>  
  
  <samp>such as '<','<=','>','>='. While the switch case does not recognize the comparison operator.</samp> 
  
  <samp>Format :</samp> 
  ```java
  
        switch (variable) {

          case 1:
            
            // when the value of 'variable' is equal to 1, then code 'A' will be executed.
            
            break;
            
          case 2:
          
            // when the value of 'variable is equal to 2, then code 'B' will be executed.
          
            break;
            
          case 3:
          
          
            // when the value of 'variable' is equal to 3, then code 'C' will be executed.
            
            break;
          
          default:
          
            // When the value of 'variable' is not equal to all CASE conditions, the 'default' command will be executed.
          
        }
  ```
