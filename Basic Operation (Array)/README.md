## Basic Operation (Array)
##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- <samp>The 'toString' function in the 'Arrays' class is to convert Array data into String values. parameter in this</samp> 
 
  <samp>function is Array data.</samp>

- <samp>Copy Array data can use the 'for' loop or can use the 'copyOf' function from the 'Arrays' class</samp>  
 
  <samp>and has 2 parameters, namely the Array data and the index length of the Array data to be copied.</samp>
  
- <samp>Copying array data by specifying the range index can use the 'copyOfRange' function in the 'Arrays' class and has 3 parameters,</samp> 
  
  <samp> namely array data, the beginning and end of the range index to be copied.</samp>
  
-  <samp>Filling Values in Arrays with the same Value can use the 'fill' function in the 'Arrays' class. The 'fill' function </samp> 

   <samp>has 2 parameters, namely the Array data and the value of each Array index.</samp>
   
- <samp>The 'equals' function in the 'Arrays' class is to compare 2 array data whether they have the same value.</samp>
 
  <samp>function 'equals' has 2 parameters, namely data Array 1 and data Array 2 and has a return value is a boolean value (true / false).</samp>
  
- <samp>The 'compare' function in the 'Arrays' class is to compare 2 arrays of data. the 'compare' function has 2 parameters, </samp>

  <samp>namely data array 1 and data array 2. when data 1 is greater than data 2 then the return value is 1, but when data 2 is </samp>
  
  <samp>greater than data 1 then the return value is -1 and when 2 is data array the same value will return a return value of 0.</samp>
