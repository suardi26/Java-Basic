## If Statement
##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- <samp>if-else statement / branching is a programming technique used to determine the flow of execution program.</samp> 
 
  <samp>for example: when the condition is true then "program code A"  will be executed, but when If the condition</samp>
  
  <samp>evaluates to false, then "program code B" will be executed.</samp>

  <samp>Format :</samp> 
  
  ```java
  if (condition) {

    // if the condition is true then code 'A' will be executed

  } else {

    // if the condition is false then code 'B' will be executed

  }
  ```
- <samp>if-else if statement / branching is the same as 'if-else statement' which is a programming technique that used to </samp>  

  <samp>determine the flow of program execution, but the difference in the 'if-else if' conditions can be more than one.</samp>
  
  <samp>Format :</samp>
  
   ```java
   if (condition1) {

   // if the condition1 is true then code 'A' will be executed

   } else if (condition2) {

     // if the condition2 is true then code 'B' will be executed

   } else if (condition3){

     // if the condition3 is true then code 'C' will be executed

   } else if{

     // . . . . .

     // . . . . .

     // . . . . .

   }else{

     // This code will be executed if all conditions are not true

   }
   ```
  
 - <samp>If else nested is a programming technique used to define the execution flow program, but in if else nested there is a branch</samp> 

   <samp>in the branch. So that when a condition is met there is still another branch that determines a condition is true or not.</samp>

   <samp>Format :</samp>
   
    
  ```java
  if (condition1) {

     if (condition2) {

       // if the condition1 and condition2 is true then code 'A' will be executed

     else{

       // if the condition1 is true and condition2 is false then code 'B' will be execute 

     }

  }else{

    // if the condition1 is false then code 'C' will be execute.

  }
  
  ```
