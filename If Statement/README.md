## If Statement
##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- <samp>if-else statement / branching is a programming technique used to determine the flow of execution program. for example: when the condition</samp> 
 
  <samp>is true then "program code A"  will be executed, but when If the condition evaluates to false, then "program code B" will be executed.</samp>

  <samp>Format :</samp> 
  
  ```java
  if (condition) {

    // if the condition is true then code 'A' will be executed

  } else {

    // if the condition is false then code 'B' will be executed

  }
  ```
- <samp>if-else if statement / branching is the same as 'if-else statement' which is a programming technique that used to determine</samp>  

  <samp>the flow of program execution, but the difference in the 'if-else if' conditions can be more than one.</samp>
