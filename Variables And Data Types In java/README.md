## Variables And Data Types In java
##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- <samp>Variables are used to store data according to the specified data type.</samp>

- <samp>Variable names that cannot be used are keywords in Java such as class, package, private, etc.</samp>

- <samp>For example: "double ioT = 3;" //Note: The variable name is ioT and the data type is double and the value is 3.</samp>

- <samp>There are 8 basic data types in Java such as: byte, short, integer, long, float, double, boolean, char.</samp>

- <samp>For byte,short,integer,long are numeric data types and are integers, and have the following capacities:</samp>
  
  * <samp>byte = has a capacity of 8 bits, and the interval starts from -128 to 127.</samp>
   
  * <samp>short = has a capacity of 16 bits, and the interval starts from -32768 to 32767.</samp>
   
  * <samp>integer = has a capacity of 32 bits, and the interval starts from -2147483648 to 2147483647.</samp>
   
  * <samp>long = has a capacity of 64 bits, and the interval starts from -9223372036854775808 from 9223372036854775807.</samp>
  
- <samp>for float and double are numeric data types and are decimal numbers, and have the following capacities:</samp>

  * <samp>float = has a capacity of 32 bits, and the interval starts from 1.4E-45 to 3.4028235E38.</samp>
  
  * <samp>double = has a capacity of 64 bits, and the interval starts from 4.9E-324 to 1.7976931348623157E308.</samp>
  
- <samp>For the selection of numeric data types, either integers or decimal numbers, select according to the required capacity so as to save memory usage.</samp>

- <samp>For the char data type, it is a data type that is included in the character group and can only accommodate 1 character.</samp>

- <samp>For the boolean data type, it is a data type that belongs to a logical group and has a value of true or false.</samp>

- <samp>Have a nice day.</samp>
