## Exception
##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- <samp>When the program code (Java) has been compiled and executed, errors can occur at runtime, such as data input errors or other</samp> 
 
  <samp>unexpected things. the error causes the program to stop and produces an error message this term is called throw an exception.</samp>
  
- <samp>Exception Handling is a facility in Java that is used to overcome runtime errors by catch the error message so that</samp> 
 
  <samp>the program does not stop but continues executing the next line of code.</samp>
  
- <samp>There are several keywords in java in terms of Exception Handling :</samp>

  - <samp>Try.</samp>

    <samp>Try is a keyword that is used to try to run a program block that has the potential to cause an error at runtime.</samp> 

    <samp>This keyword is paired with the catch or finally keyword.</samp>

  - <samp>Catch.</samp>

    <samp>Catch is the keyword used to catch errors that occur from the try block and can be displayed in this catch block.</samp>

  - <samp>Finally.</samp>

    <samp>Finally is the keyword used to run the program block that will be executed after the program block in the try and catch.</samp> 

    <samp>The program block in finally will be executed when there is an error or no error.</samp>

  - <samp>Throw</samp>

    <samp>throw is the keyword used to throw a manually generated error message.</samp>

    <samp>format : 'throw new Exception("Error Occurred!!")'.</samp>

  - <samp>Throws</samp>

    <samp>throws is a keyword used in a method that might generate an error, so to call the method, an exception handling (try-catch) must be done first.</samp>
