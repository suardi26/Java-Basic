## For Looping
##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- <samp>For Looping is a programming technique used to repeat the process until a condition is not met. However, in the 'For' loop,</samp>

  <samp>there are 3 statements, namely: Initialization, a condition, Increment/decrement.</samp>
  
    <samp>  Format :</samp>
 
    ```java
    for (Initialization; condition; Increment/decrement) {

        // Code will be executed.
    }
    ```
  
    <samp>  Example :</samp>

    ```java
    int y = 5;

    for (int x = 1; y >= x ; x++) {

        System.out.println("number "+x);
    }    
    ```
  
- <samp>Nested For is the same as 'for loop' which is a programming technique used to loop through the process until a condition </samp> 

  <samp>is not met. However, in 'nested for' there is a loop in the loop.</samp>
        
    <samp>  Format :</samp>
    
    ```java
    for (Initialization; condition; Increment/decrement) {

        for(Initialization; condition; Increment/decrement){

        // Code will be executed.

        }
    }
    ```
    
    <samp>  Example :</samp>

    ```java
    int i,n;

      for (i = 0; i < 6; i++){

        for (n = 0; n < 6; n++){

          System.out.print("* ");

        }
    System.out.println();
    }
    ```
