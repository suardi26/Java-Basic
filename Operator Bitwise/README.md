## Operators Bitwise
##### Notes !!! : this script is intended for those who are just starting to learn java. If you already understand basic Java, please skip it.

- <samp>Bitwise operators are special operators to handle logical operations of binary numbers in the form of bits.</samp>

- <samp>Binary number itself is a type of number that only consists of 2 types of numbers, such as 0 and 1.</samp>

- <samp>Types of Bitwise Operators :</samp>

    * <samp>Left shift is an operator that Shifts the bit position in the x variable to the left.</samp>
      
      <samp>Example :</samp> 
      ```java
      y = (bytes) (x << 1); // Shifts the bit position in the x variable to the left by 1 bit.
      ```
    * <samp>Right shift is an operator that shifts the bit position in the y variable to the right.</samp>
      
      <samp>Example :</samp>
      
      x = (byte) (y >> 1); // Shifts the bit position in the y variable to the right by 1 bit.
      
    * <samp>Bitwise OR operator is a logical OR operator that processes bits per bit of both variables.</samp>

    * <samp>Bitwise AND operator is a logical AND operator that processes bit by bit of both variables.</samp>

    * <samp>Bitwise XOR operator is a logical XOR operator that processes bit by bit of both variables.</samp>

    * <samp>Bitwise NOT operator is a logical NOT operator that processes bit by bit of a variable.</samp>
